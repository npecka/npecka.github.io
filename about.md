I’m a Cybersecurity Engineer based in the Midwest with a passion for problem-solving and technology. My journey started back in 2000 when I got my first computer, and I’ve been hooked ever since—curious, hands-on, and always eager to dive into the next challenge.

When I’m not securing systems or analyzing threats, I’m likely enjoying time with friends—whether that’s playing video games, snowboarding/skiing, getting competitive in sports, or battling it out in trading card games like MTG and Pokémon. I’m also a lifelong learner currently exploring new languages こんにちは!
